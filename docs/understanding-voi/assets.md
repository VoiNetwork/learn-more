# Assets

Assets on Voi come in two distinct types, each powerful and capable of being leveraged in different ways to achieve similar outcomes.

Both types can represent fungible and non-fungible resources on the Voi blockchain as assets.

The main difference is that Standard Assets require the recipient to opt-in to receive the asset first and are not as extensible as Smart Assets.

### Smart Assets

Smart Assets are represented by smart contracts and are created and managed through transactions that interact with these contracts.


### Standard Assets

Standard Assets do not require smart contracts; they are created and managed solely through transactions.

##### Voi

Voi is the native asset of the Voi chain, primarily used for participation and fee payments. It can also be utilized for purchasing services or other assets, such as NFTs, Standard Assets, and Smart Assets.

##### VSA (ASA)

VSA (also known as ASA which stands for Algorand Standard Asset) is an asset type built into the AVM that offers basic token functionality. Despite being a standard asset, its use is not widespread on the Voi Chain. To date, VSA is primarily used as an early access token in the NFT launchpad High Forge and in the liquid staking token dVoi.
