# Voi Services Bounty Board

## Introduction
Welcome to the Voi Services Bounty Board! Here, Core Partners, including individuals and DAOs, can take on key responsibilities that drive the success and sustainability of the Voi blockchain ecosystem. By participating, you'll help decentralize essential tasks, contribute to the community's growth, and earn rewards for your efforts.

Rather than having fixed bounties, service providers are encouraged to submit transparent bids for fulfilling these responsibilities through our grants process. The community will review these bids, ensuring a competitive and fair selection process. This approach not only promotes decentralized decision-making, accountability, and innovation but also ensures that the most efficient and capable partners are entrusted with these critical tasks.

By leveraging the collective strength of Core Partners, especially those structured as DAOs, Voi fosters a truly decentralized ecosystem where decision-making and execution are community-driven and efficient.

## What Are Core Partners?
Core Partners are either individuals or entities, such as DAOs, within the Voi ecosystem that fulfill roles traditionally managed by centralized foundations. Instead of relying on a large foundation payroll, Voi empowers these partners to execute key tasks in exchange for tokens approved through community-led grant proposals.

This decentralized model encourages efficiency, innovation, and accountability. Core Partners aim to deliver high-quality services while minimizing costs, making the ecosystem more competitive. They are incentivized to explore creative solutions, including creating and distributing their own tokens, which can be integrated into their operations. For instance, a DAO acting as a Core Partner might distribute grant rewards among its token holders, rewarding those who add value to the ecosystem.

## How Core Partners Operate

- Decentralized Execution: Core Partners are encouraged to form DAOs that collectively address challenges within the ecosystem, such as marketing, education, or network maintenance.

- Incentivized Contribution: Core Partners are compensated for their services through tokens, ensuring that contributions are both recognized and rewarded.

- Community-Driven: All rewards and grants are approved by the community, promoting transparency and ensuring that the most valuable contributions receive support.

By leveraging the collective strength of Core Partners, Voi fosters a truly decentralized ecosystem where decision-making and execution are community-driven and efficient.
