# Overview

Welcome to the **Voi Grants & Proposals Program**. The Voi Grants & Proposals Program is central to the Voi ecosystem. The program aims to support and accelerate the development of innovative products and projects within the Voi ecosystem, including the implementation of policies and procedures that will sustain the growth and operations of the ecosystem. By providing funding, resources, and mentorship, the program empowers builders, marketers, and educators to create impactful solutions that align with Voi's mission and add long-term value to the Voi community. It is where promising open-source community-centric product and ecosystem services projects get funded. The significant allocation of Voi’s treasury towards fudingin ecosystem projects  differentiates us from other networks, solidifying our commitment to ensuring a majority of resources are used to incentivize and reward efforts by our community.

# Grants Program Mission

Voi’s Grants Program exists to drive community-led innovation by putting tokens into the hands of contributors who deliver real value. We fund high-impact projects that strengthen Voi’s position as a leading community-driven blockchain, with the infrastructure to support diverse communities and their unique use cases.


# Who is Funding Available For? 

Voi provides grant funding for anyone eager to build applications and products within the Voi ecosystem. This includes but is not limited to Developers, Entrepreneurs, and Core Partners or community members with an ability to provide services for the ecosystem. 


# Grants Program Funding Categories 

Voi has four major categories for grants and proposals: **Product Grants**, **Ecosystem Services Grants**, **Ecosystem Initiative Grants**, and **Policy & Procedure Proposals**. 

* **Product Grants**: Focus on advancing the technical and infrastructural aspects of the Voi ecosystem, supporting projects that drive innovation on the network, create new Voi applications, and/or enhance existing platforms. Grants exist for products at various stages of the development process.
  
* **Ecosystem Services Grants**: Foster the growth and sustainability of the broader Voi community, providing funding for services that contribute to the ecosystem in the form of educational content, marketing support, community engagement, developer resources, etc. Many of our third party service providers will be interested in this grant category.
  
* **Ecosystem Initiative Grants**: Dedicated for discrete ecosystem programs and events that are generally managed and executed within the Voi community (ex. a hackathon, a campaign).
  
* **Policy & Procedure Proposals**: Non-token backed, proposals unlike grants exist for Voi's committees to push forward (or remove) policies and procedures (including amendments to the Constitution) that enhance the overal operations and goals of the ecosystem.
