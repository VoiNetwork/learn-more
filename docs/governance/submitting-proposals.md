# Overview

Welcome to the **Voi Grants & Proposals Program**. The Voi Grants & Proposals Program is central to the Voi ecosystem. The program aims to support and accelerate the development of innovative products and projects within the Voi ecosystem, including the implementation of policies and procedures that will sustain the growth and operations of the ecosystem. By providing funding, resources, and mentorship, the program empowers builders, marketers, and educators to create impactful solutions that align with Voi's mission and add long-term value to the Voi community. It is where promising open-source community-centric product and ecosystem services projects get funded. The significant allocation of Voiâ€™s treasury towards fudingin ecosystem projects  differentiates us from other networks, solidifying our commitment to ensuring a majority of resources are used to incentivize and reward efforts by our community.
