# Welcome

Welcome to the **Voi Grants & Proposals Program**!

The Voi Grants & Proposals Program is central to the Voi ecosystem. The program a**ims to support and accelerate the development of innovative products and projects within the Voi ecosystem, including the implementation of policies and procedures that will sustain the growth and operations of the ecosystem**.

By providing funding, resources, and mentorship, the program empowers builders, marketers, and educators to create impactful solutions that align with Voi's mission and add long-term value to the Voi community. It is where promising open-source community-centric product and ecosystem services projects get funded. The significant allocation of Voi’s treasury towards funding ecosystem projects  differentiates us from other networks, solidifying our commitment to ensuring a majority of Voi's resources are used to incentivize and reward efforts by our community. 

This comprehensive [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rgZcpBtZY0rwq3W6-omnRjIGg54T8G3w1xjA_2usg84/edit) provides an in-depth look at the proposal submission process for obtaining grant funding from the Voi Foundation. The information presented here in the website will provide potential applicants with a high level overview on the types of grants available to the Voi community and how to submit an application for funding. 

# Grants Program Mission

**Voi’s Grants Program** exists to drive community-led innovation by putting tokens into the hands of contributors who deliver real value. We fund high-impact projects that strengthen Voi’s position as a leading community-driven blockchain, with the infrastructure to support diverse communities and their unique use cases.


# Who is Funding Available For? 

Voi provides grant funding for anyone eager to build applications and products within the Voi ecosystem. This includes but is not limited to Developers, Entrepreneurs, and Core Partners or community members with an ability to provide services for the ecosystem. 

# How to Use this Documentation

Voi's Grants & Proposals documentation is broken down by funding types. [Types of Funding](https://docs.voi.network/governance/proposals/types-of-grants/) provides an overview of all the different grants and proposals available to Voi's community and core partners. It then goes through each grant and proposal type in further detail. The [Application Process](https://docs.voi.network/governance/proposals/application-process/) educates applicants on what to expect in terms of the grants review process while the [Grants Calendar](https://docs.voi.network/governance/proposals/grants-calendar/) outlines each month when the Voi Council will be accepting new applications (generally the first two weeks of every month). [Links & Resources](https://docs.voi.network/governance/proposals/links-and-resources/) collates all application materials in a central place for quick access. The Voi Council grants team can be contacted at any time in Discord or at grants@voi.network.
