# Voi’s Constitution - First Draft 

## Mission

The mission of Voi is to create a community-driven blockchain (CDB) ecosystem **built** by the community, **run** by the community and **owned** by the community.


## Preamble 

The Voi community, with the goal of building a truly decentralized network grounded on the principles of **goodwill**, **integrity**, **collaboration**, and **intentionality**, built by the community, owned by the community, and run by the community, herein establishes Voi's Constitution. 

This Constitution is driven by a fundamental principle: **ensuring that power is distributed equitably**, preventing any single person or entity from consolidating control in what we aim to be a truly decentralized network. 

Voi is designed to be an open protocol that grows and evolves over time as democratically decided upon by the community. Processes have been put in place to support this evolution through clear pathways for change and constitutional amendments that reflect what Voi is today and in the future.

This ensures that Voi evolves with the needs of the community and that projects building on top of Voi are able to do so with the knowledge that their data and services will not be restricted by a centralized entity or otherwise. 


## Structural Overview

Voi's governance model is inspired by the tripartite system used in various global governments, with its own unique adaptations. This model is structured around three distinct branches: Voi Judicial, Voi Council, and Voi Treasury, each tasked with specific functions and responsibilities to ensure equitable distribution of power and prevent dominance by any single person or entity. This tripartite system has been adopted to promote a community-driven approach, democratizing decision-making and maintaining the blockchain's operation in the best interest of its whole ecosystem. 

- **Voi Council**: This branch comprises community-elected members who reflect the community's voice, interest and priorities. It is responsible for crafting and modifying governance rules, as well as proposing new initiatives. By electing community members into the Voi Council, the governance model ensures that the blockchain remains responsive to the needs and aspirations of its users. 

- **Voi Treasury**: This branch includes the community-elected President and the judicially appointed Board of Directors. It is responsible for the implementation of policies and decisions formulated by the Council, aligning daily operations with the community’s values and objectives.

- **Voi Judicial**: This branch provides guidance and ensures continuity. It safeguards the constitution and the blockchain’s core principles, acting as a guardian against unnecessary or capricious changes, and ensures amendments are justified and significant.

Voi’s governance model is built on the principle of checks and balances, ensuring that no branch overpowers another and that the blockchain remains a balanced, transparent, and equitable system. In adopting a tripartite system with robust checks and balances, Voi establishes a governance model that is transparent, fair, and adaptable, capable of evolving with the blockchain's needs and the community it serves. This instills a sense of ownership and responsibility across the ecosystem, ensuring that Voi remains a truly community-driven platform.


## Article I: Core Values of the Ecosystem

Voi is governed by the following fundamental values. Outlined here in Article 1 are these core values.

## Article II: Goals of the Ecosystem

Outlined within Article 2 are the five main goals of Voi’s ecosystem. These are the fundamental pillars that are meant to govern Voi’s decision-making as the network and community membership grows: 

### Public

The ecosystem must be universally accessible and engaging for the public, ensuring that it supports a wide range of interactions and contributions without barriers to entry regardless of one’s experience in web3. 

#### Open Access

Guarantee that the ecosystem is accessible to everyone and every entity, without financial, technical, or geographical barriers.

This facilitates a genuinely inclusive platform where anyone can participate, learn, and contribute, directly aligning with the public nature of the ecosystem.

#### No Censorship

Ensure the right not to be censored on the blockchain. Ensure freedom of speech and expression within the ecosystem, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and information within the limits of Voi’s core values. 

This supports an open dialogue and the exchange of diverse perspectives, critical for a public platform that thrives on community contributions and innovation.

#### Transparency

Operations, decision-making processes, and data within the ecosystem should be transparent when possible and open to scrutiny by all participants.

This builds trust among users and stakeholders, essential for a public ecosystem where accountability and openness are valued.

### Decentralization

The ecosystem must operate on a decentralized model, removing single points of control or failure and distributing power among its participants.

#### Governance

Implement a decentralized governance model that allows participants to have a say in the ecosystem's evolution and decision-making processes.

This empowers community members by giving them an active role in governance, reinforcing the decentralized nature of the ecosystem.

#### Independent Nodes

Encourage the development and operation of independent nodes to enhance the network's resilience and decentralization.

This reduces reliance on any central authority, ensuring that the ecosystem remains robust, secure, and truly decentralized.
