# Breakdown of Voi's Grants & Proposals

Voi has four major categories for grants and proposals: **Product Grants**, **Ecosystem Services Grants**, **Ecosystem Initiative Grants**, and **Policy & Procedure Proposals**. 

**1. Product Grants**: Focus on advancing the technical and infrastructural aspects of the Voi ecosystem, supporting projects that drive innovation on the network, create new Voi applications, and/or enhance existing platforms. Grants exist for products at various stages of the development process.

**There are five types of product grants:**

   * **Design Grants**:Intended to validate ideas and concepts, helping developers prepare a detailed Product Blueprint for a successful build and launch on Voi.
   * **Build Grants**: Focused on the actual development and milestone-based funding of projects that have a completed Product Blueprint.
   * **Retroactive Grants**: Available for already completed and launched open-source projects or open-source features of otherwise closed-source projects on Voi with proven traction and track record of success.
   * **Micro Grants**: Microgrants are available for small scale development projects. They are dedicated to individuals eager to build out a project small in scope that may not require a full on product blueprint or significant development time. Micro grants will generally be less than $10,000 in funding. 
   * **Success Grants**: Success grants are dedicated to applications and products launched on Voi that surpass milestones and expectations within the ecosytem and have achieved a particular degree of traction and success within the ecosystem.
     
**2. Ecosystem Services Grants**: Foster the growth and sustainability of the broader Voi community, providing funding for services that contribute to the ecosystem in the form of educational content, marketing support, community engagement, developer resources, etc. Many of our third party service providers will be interested in this grant category.This includes but is by no means limited to: marketing projects for Voi, writing articles for Voi’s blog, developing educational materials, contributing to Voi’s documentation, and supporting the development of governance tools. Microgrants are also available for ecosystem services. 

**3. Ecosystem Initiative Grants**: Dedicated for discrete ecosystem programs and events that are generally managed and executed within the Voi community (ex. a hackathon, a campaign). Microgrants are also available for ecosystem initiatives. 
  
**4. Policy & Procedure Proposals**: Non-token backed, proposals unlike grants exist for Voi's committees to push forward (or remove) policies and procedures (including amendments to the Constitution) that enhance the overal operations and goals of the ecosystem.
