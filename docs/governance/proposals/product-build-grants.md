# Build Grants

Build Grants are designed to take a project from blueprint to reality, supporting the full development and implementation of products on the Voi network, milestone by milestone. After completing a Product Blueprint in the design phase, the development team will execute their plan to bring a validated product to market-ready status. Build Grants provide funding for the entire lifecycle—covering development, testing, deployment, and initial marketing, as well as offering rewards for exceeding expectations and achieving notable success within the Voi ecosystem.

Unlike Design Grants, which focus on concept validation, research, and blueprint creation, Build Grants support the entire development process. This includes coding, testing, launch, and post-launch improvements, ensuring the project is fully functional and ready for the market. Funding is released based on milestone achievements to guarantee accountability and sustained progress. The ultimate goal is for Build Grants to deliver high-impact, long-term contributions to the Voi ecosystem.

Important: All Build Grant applicants must submit a completed Product Blueprint as part of their application. This ensures critical questions have been addressed before investing in the build phase. If developers have already completed the necessary research, they can skip the Product Design Grant and simply submit the blueprint with their Build Grant application. In some cases, the team that created the blueprint may not be the team that carries out the development. The development work can be outsourced, or other teams/companies can bid to complete the product outlined in the blueprint as part of their Build Grant submission.
