# Policy & Procedure Proposals

Policy grants within the Voi ecosystem are designed to support initiatives that propose, amend, or remove policies or procedures without financial or token-based incentives. These proposals aim to improve the overall operations and functioning of the Voi ecosystem, ensuring we have the infrastructure and procedures in place to be a secure and scalable ecosystem and one that continues to remain driven by the community. 

*Policy & Procedure proposals along with Amendment proposals can be submitted by Committees or Council members only. If the proposal has originated from one of Voi’s committees it must achieve a majority vote by all voting members within a 48-hour voting period prior to being presented to the Council.*


## Policy & Procedure Creation and Removal Proposals

Policy & Procedure Creation Proposals support initiatives focused on enacting new policy changes within the Voi ecosystem. This grant is designed for projects that aim to refine, alter, or introduce policies to enhance governance, efficiency, or community engagement (rather than to develop specific products or services). These grants are crucial for committees as they directly influence the policies and operational frameworks that affect their respective interest groups. Ideal candidates are those who propose clear, impactful changes that align with Voi’s objectives and demonstrate a well-thought-out plan for implementation and evaluation. Policy & Procedure Removal Proposals specifically fund initiatives to reverse or amend existing policies that are deemed outdated, inefficient, or counterproductive. This grant targets projects focused on meticulous review and critical assessment of current policies, enabling stakeholders to propose necessary modifications or complete removals that will streamline operations and enhance the ecosystem's adaptability and effectiveness.
