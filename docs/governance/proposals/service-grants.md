# Ecosystem Services Grants

Ecosystem Services grants are for community members, core partners, and other third party providers to support Voi in a wide spectrum of areas from marketing to education to resource development. Many different types of projects may fall under this category. Service grants are designed to support projects that provide essential services to the Voi ecosystem but are not centered around product development. These grants fund services that enhance the overall infrastructure, governance, education, community engagement, documentation,  and other critical functions that help the ecosystem thrive. 

Service Grants are aimed at initiatives that strengthen the foundation and sustainability of the Voi network, ensuring long-term growth and success.For example, a service project could include one of the following but is by no means limited to this list: ecosystem growth plan, a security audit, administrative support for the Council, development of a multi-tier education curriculum for Voi, third party node management support, etc.

- Community feedback - regularly seek out community feedback on your service in the proposal channel on discord and via a Voi AMA (request your project be featured on Voi’s next AMA). Use this feedback to continually improve your service .

### Micro Service Proposals

Similar to product grants, ecosystem services also has small scalle micro grants available. These grants are great for individuals that would like to provide a service to Voi that is small in scope (less than $10,000 worth of Voi). This may include writing articles for Voi’s blog, developing educational materials, contributing to Voi’s documentation, etc.
