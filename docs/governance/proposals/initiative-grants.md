# Ecosystem Initiative Grants

Ecosystem Initiative Grants are dedicated to supporting discrete programs and events that foster engagement and growth within the Voi community. Unlike service grants, which are aimed at providing ongoing services to the ecosystem, these grants focus on initiatives like hackathons, campaigns, and other short-term projects that help to drive specific outcomes or enhance community participation. Microgrants are also available for smaller-scale initiatives, making it easier for individuals or groups to execute impactful, time-limited activities within the ecosystem.

## Micro Grants
