# Design Grants

The Product Design Grant is designed to help validate your idea or the problem you aim to solve. Rooted in the principles of lean startup methodology and disciplined entrepreneurship, this grant focuses on research, iterative development, and testing. It provides a structured framework for builders and entrepreneurs to assess whether their vision should move forward. Key considerations include evaluating if the problem is real, whether there’s a market opportunity, if potential customers find the idea compelling, and if a sustainable business model exists. If you're seeking to explore these questions before committing significant resources, this grant is tailored for you. The final deliverable of the Product Design Grant is a comprehensive Product Blueprint.

## Product Blueprint Deliverable

The Product Blueprint is a comprehensive document required as the final deliverable for the Product Design Grant. It serves as a prerequisite for applying for the larger Build Grants, which fund development. As part of your blueprint you will submit critical elements such as a clickable prototype (the most significant part), success KPIs, a market analysis, go-to-market strategy, technical specifications, budget estimates, and more. The blueprint ensures a thorough evaluation of your project’s feasibility, risks, and potential impact on the Voi ecosystem before moving into the build phase. This helps minimize the advancement of unfeasible projects and sets the foundation for a successful build.
