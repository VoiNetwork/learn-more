# Committees

An important part of being a member of a community driven blockchain, such as Voi, is to get involved in governance! 

Voi already has 4 committees setup with dozens of members already signed up to each, you should enroll with those that best align with you and your passions. 

This helps ensure that the Voi Council, consisting of community members, can best represent you and Voi's entire community! 

These committees also serve as a grassroots entry way into higher level governance of Voi.
