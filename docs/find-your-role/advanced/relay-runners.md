# Relay Runner Getting Started Guide

Welcome, Relay Runner! 

We’re thrilled to have you join our vibrant and dynamic community. As a Relay Runner, you play a crucial role in maintaining the network’s performance, security, and decentralization within the Voi ecosystem.

At Voi, our mission is to make blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all. We emphasize decentralization, democratic governance, and true ownership. Our vision is to empower the community through a token distribution model that reserves 75% of the ecosystem tokens for those who contribute to the network, ensuring that the community drives the network.

Relay Runners are the backbone of our network infrastructure. Your participation ensures the integrity, security, and efficiency of the Voi network by running powerful nodes and relays that support the overall ecosystem.
