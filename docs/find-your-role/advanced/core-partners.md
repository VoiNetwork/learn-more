# Core Partner Getting Started Guide

Welcome, Core Partner! 

We’re thrilled to have you join our vibrant and dynamic community. As a Core Partner, you play a crucial role in tackling significant challenges and driving the strategic initiatives within the Voi ecosystem.

At Voi, our mission is to make blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all. We emphasize decentralization, democratic governance, and true ownership.
