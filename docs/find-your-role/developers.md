# Developer Getting Started Guide

Welcome, Developer! 

We’re thrilled to have you join our innovative and dynamic community. As a Developer, you are a crucial part of Voi, helping to build, expand, and improve our ecosystem.

At Voi, our mission is to make blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all. We emphasize decentralization, democratic governance, and true ownership. Our vision is to empower the community through a token distribution model that reserves 75% of the ecosystem tokens for those who contribute to the network, ensuring that the community drives the network.

Developers are the architects of our ecosystem. Your contributions ensure the continuous growth, security, and functionality of the Voi network. By developing applications, tools, and protocols, you help drive innovation and make Voi a robust and versatile platform.
