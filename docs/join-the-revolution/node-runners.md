# Node Runner Getting Started Guide

Welcome, Node Runner! 

We’re thrilled to have you join our vibrant and dynamic community. As a Node Runner, you are an essential part of Voi, helping to maintain the security and performance of our blockchain network.

At Voi, our mission is to make blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all. We emphasize decentralization, democratic governance, and true ownership. Our vision is to empower the community through a token distribution model that reserves 75% of the ecosystem tokens for those who contribute to the network, ensuring that the community drives the network.

Node Runners are the backbone of our blockchain network. Your participation ensures the integrity, security, and efficiency of the Voi ecosystem. By running nodes, you contribute to the decentralization and robustness of our network.

We love node runners so much that 10% of the total supply goes towards block rewards.
