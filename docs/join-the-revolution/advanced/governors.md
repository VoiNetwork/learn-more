# Governors Getting Started Guide

Welcome, Governor! 

We’re thrilled to have you join our vibrant and dynamic community. As a Governor, you play a crucial role in shaping the future of the Voi ecosystem through active participation in governance and decision-making processes.

At Voi, our mission is to make blockchain technology accessible and beneficial for all. We emphasize decentralization, democratic governance, and true ownership. Our vision is to empower the community through a token distribution model that reserves 75% of the ecosystem tokens for those who contribute to the network, ensuring that the community drives the network.

Governors are the decision-makers of our community. Your contributions in governance help ensure that the Voi ecosystem remains fair, transparent, and aligned with the community’s needs and values.
